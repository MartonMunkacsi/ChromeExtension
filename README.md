# Crypkey Chrome Extension

### Mission

To make sure that the news you read is reliable and trustworthy. With our MVP: Crypkey, you will be able to analyse various news articles on your favourite sites, and determine whether those articles are dependable. The technology is not here to discredit or undermine news sources, only to help you, the reader, make better judgement of the things you read. Of course, the final decision is always yours. This is just a tool.

### How To Use

Unfortunately, the development of this extension was abandoned, and therefore is no longer usable. Google Chrome now requires a Manifest V3 for extensions and this project was developed during V2.
